This script change some Persian character position to windows keyboard layout (FAS to FA)

## ðŸš¨ **Not Recommended: A Silly Persian Keyboard Remap!** ðŸš¨
Hey there! If you're looking for a definitely not standard way to mess with your Persian keyboard layout, you've found it! But let me be clear: I DO NOT recommend using this script.
So, you know how Microsoft just *had* to invent its own totally-not-standard Persian keyboard layout? Yeah, thanks for that. ðŸ™„ Now, because of that "brilliant" decision, a lot of people are used to a layout that makes zero sense.

## Usage
Key list:
1. 'Ù¾' Character to '\\' key
2. 'Ø¦' Character to 'm' key
3. 'ØŒ'(Ú©Ø§Ù…Ø§) Character to 'f' key second level(Shift+f)

This script change 'ir' symbols file. The default path of this file is in '/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/ir'. You can also enter another path.

```sh
sudo python Change_Persian_Keyboard_To_Windows.py
```
Enter `1` for default path or enter another symbols file path.

*This script is written in such a way that other characters can be easily added to it, so it would be good if others help to complete it.*

## ðŸ›‘ But really, don't use this
Look, Persian keyboards have a proper, standard layout. Microsoft just decided to YOLO their own version, and now here we are. But that doesnâ€™t mean we have to keep the chaos going!
If you *really* want to sabotage your own keyboard, go aheadâ€”I donâ€™t give a damn. ðŸ˜†
